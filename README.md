# Kioku
Kioku (“memory” in Japanese) helps you remember birthdays, anniversaries, and other dates. Events are stored locally, with optional same-day, 1-day, and 1-week reminders at 5:00 AM. Search across events, browse by category, and use recurring support for birthdays and anniversaries—all offline with React Native and Expo.
